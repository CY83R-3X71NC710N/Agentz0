## Project Description
This project is based on the name 'Theprojectnameshouldbeobjectorientedandapocalypticin' and the description to create an AI agent that is capable of analyzing malicious code & identifying zero-day threats. The project will be written in Python, and we will be using the Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and NLTK libraries to help us achieve our goal. Our aim is to create a prototype that can effectively detect zero-day threats and protect systems from malicious activity. 

## Goals 
- Create an AI agent capable of analyzing malicious code & identifying zero-day threats 
- Utilize machine learning & natural language processing with Python libraries Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow & NLTK
- Create a prototype for corporations and individuals who want to contribute 
- Fulfill the project description by creating an AI agent that can detect zero-day threats and protect systems from malicious activity
- Design the project in a way that will facilitate open source alternatives to any closed-source APIs 
- Develop the project in an object-oriented way, making sure it is up-to-date with the latest technologies 
- Integrate advanced markdown to create a unique and beautiful README.md 
- The code should be efficient and under 100 lines long 

## Roadmap 
- Create a basic blueprint of the project 
- Research the libraries and APIs utilized by the project 
- Implement a simple machine learning algorithm 
- Utilize natural language processing for improved accuracy 
- Test the AI agent's accuracy in identifying malicious code 
- Improve performance of the model by optimizing it for better memory usage 
- Make sure the model runs on the reader's own machine, including URLs and other keys
- Add a copyright notice to the README.md for the year 2023
- Include the license details for the project 

## Advanced Markdown 
For this project, all markdown code should be both functional and beautiful. This includes all section heading, as well as tables, images, and other formatting. Each line of code should be commented so that the code can be understood more easily, and line numbers should be used where appropriate. 

## APIs 
Any API used in this project should be considered to be closed source and in a state of constant evolution. As a result, an open source alternative should be created to allow others to contribute to the project. 

## Prototype 
This prototype should be considered a work in progress. As such, it should be built upon and extended to become more powerful. In the README.md, the project name should be listed at the bottom and followed by the copyright symbol and the year 2023.

## License 
The license that should be used is an MIT license and can be found in the root of the GitHub repository, titled LICENSE. The username for the Git repo is 'CY83R-3X71NC710N'.
